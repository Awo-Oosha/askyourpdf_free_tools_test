      "Seamless and quick. I have been supporting similar apps on Product Hunt, but this one seems to have the least downtime (maybe no one knows about it), but the customer service and accuracy of the LLM. data model and prompts seem to be above the rest of them. I would surely pay in the future to be apart of something great. In the meantime, I am loving the process and how this product saved me hours of reading time for a 125 page document. Best of luck and much success in becoming the next unicorn in the space.",
